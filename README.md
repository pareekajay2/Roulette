# Roulette
The program that I'd like you to build is called ProductRoulette. It can be a command-line tool. A user enters her email and persona (developer, salesperson, marketing, hr, engineering manager, etc.), and the program immediately starts showing interesting B2B products that she may or may not like to adopt at her company. Depending on the feedback (we can play around with what we seek as feedback but it needs to be unobtrusive and non-lengthy), the program gets progressively smarter and gets the user's stack interest profile. This Interest/Taste graph can also be used for the next user, creating a network effect. Like a Tinder/Netflix for Software Products.
